# Clean Features

Compute ‘clean’ high-level features for a batch of images with a deep computer vision model.

Currently available models:

- Inception v3

This is a custom implementation that builds on the best practices and partially on the implementation of [GaParmar/clean-fid](https://github.com/GaParmar/clean-fid).
